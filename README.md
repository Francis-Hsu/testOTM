# testOTM
This repository contains a package which implements multivariate ranks and quantiles, together with their application in statistical testing, that based upon semi-discrete optimal transport theory. The underlying geometric computation is done through [Geogram](http://alice.loria.fr/index.php/software/4-library/75-geogram.html).

## Installation
In R console, run `devtools::install_github("Francis-Hsu/testOTM")`.

## Example
```R
library(testOTM)

# generate some data points
X = cbind(c(0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.1, 0.2), 
          c(0.7, 0.2, 0.8, 0.7, 0.1))
          
# compute the optimal transport map from a 2D uniform measure to the data
X.OTM = OTM_2D(X) 

# plot the restricted Voronoi diagram and the restricted Delaunay triangulation 
plot(X.OTM, which = "Both", draw.map = T)
```
