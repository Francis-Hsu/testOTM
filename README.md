# testOTM
This repository contains a package which implements the multivariate ranks and quantiles, together with their application in statistical testing, that based on the semi-discrete optimal transportation. The underlying geometric computation is performed by the [Geogram](http://alice.loria.fr/index.php/software/4-library/75-geogram.html) library.

## Installation
In R, run `devtools::install_github("Francis-Hsu/testOTM")`.

## Example
```R
library(testOTM)

# generate some data
n = 100
X = cbind(rnorm(n, 0, 1), rnorm(n, 0, 0.5))

# scale the data to [0, 1] range
X = scaling.min.max(X)

# compute the optimal transport map from U[0, 1]^2 to the data
X.OTM = otm.fit(X)

# plot the restricted Voronoi diagram and the restricted Delaunay triangulation 
plot(X.OTM, which = "Both", draw.map = T)
```
