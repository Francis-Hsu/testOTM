# testOTM
This repository contains a package which implements multivariate ranks and quantiles, together with their application in statistical testing, that based upon semi-discrete optimal transport theory. The underlying geometric computation is done through [Geogram](http://alice.loria.fr/index.php/software/4-library/75-geogram.html).

## Installation
In R console, run `devtools::install_github("Francis-Hsu/testOTM")`.
