# testOTM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains a R package which implements the multivariate ranks and quantiles, together with their application in statistical testing, that based on the semi-discrete optimal transportation.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of testOTM from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("testOTM")
```
-->
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("Francis-Hsu/testOTM")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use `testOTM` to visualize the optimal transport map from $U[0, 1]^2$ to a dataset:

```{r example}
library(testOTM)

# generate some data
p = 2
n = 100
Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), 2, 2)
eS = eigen(Sigma, symmetric = TRUE)
X = t(eS$vectors %*% diag(sqrt(pmax(eS$values, 0)), p) %*% matrix(rnorm(p * n), p))

# scale the data to [0, 1] range
X = scaling.min.max(X)

# compute the optimal transport map from U[0, 1]^2 to the data
X.OTM = tos.fit(X)

# plot the restricted Voronoi diagram and the restricted Delaunay triangulation
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(X.OTM, which = "Both", draw.center = F, draw.map = T)
```
