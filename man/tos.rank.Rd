\title{Semi-discrete Optimal Transport Rank}
\usage{
tos.rank(
  object,
  query,
  scale = TRUE,
  rank.data = "uniform",
  rank.algo = "lp",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted optimal transport map object.}

\item{query}{a numeric matrix where each row represents a query point.}

\item{scale}{logical indicating if the queries should be scaled.}

\item{rank.data}{choose the method for assigning ranks to the data points. 
Can be \code{max}, \code{min}, \code{center}, or \code{uniform}.}

\item{rank.algo}{choose the algorithm for computing the ranks. Can be \code{lp} or \code{geom}.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments.}
}
\value{
a list containing the ranks of the data and the corresponding convex conjugate potential values.
If \code{rank.algo = "geom"} or data points are presented in the queries,
then the corresponding conjugate potentials will not be computed (\code{NA}s will be returned).
}
\description{
\code{tos.rank} computes the optimal transport ranks.
}
\details{
The rank of the a data points used to fit the optimal transport map is not uniquely defined. 
In principle it can be any point within the corresponding Laguerre cell. 
Set \code{rank.data} to \code{max} to use the vertices with the maximum l2 norm (\code{min} for minimum l2 norm),
which is analogous to the usual ECDF rank in 1D. Option \code{center} will assign the centroid of the cell as the rank.
Finally, option \code{uniform} will sample a point uniformly from the Laguerre cell as the rank.

The rank for a non-data query point can be computed by solving a series of linear programs, 
or by finding the intersection of Laguerre cells that correspond to the simplex containing the query.
Set \code{rank.algo} to \code{lp} to use the former and \code{geom} for the latter.
Note the geometric method is slow and does not work for points lie outside the RDT, it is also not implemented for 3D, 
\code{lp} method will be used in these cases.
