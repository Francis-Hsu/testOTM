\title{2D Semi-discrete Optimal Transport Rank}
\usage{
\method{otm.rank}{OTM.2D}(object, Q, use.geo = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted 2D optimal transport map object.}

\item{Q}{a numeric matrix where each row represents a query point.}

\item{use.geo}{logical indicating if the geometric method should be used to compute the ranks.}
}
\value{
a list containing the ranks of the data and the corresponding convex conjugate potential values.
Noted that if the geometric method is used for ranks then the convex conjugates will not be computed (will return NA).
}
\description{
Compute the 2D optimal transport ranks.
